            <p>Hello! I am Abiola “Abi” [to give birth to] and “Ola” [honor or wealth] Majors, and welcome to my UX portfolio. I’m a UX designer and researcher who in former life was an Atlanta-based home furnishings design rep. I am passionate about this new career path and thoroughly enjoy applying the five-steps of the design thinking process.</p>
            <p>My design thinking process is built on the core, the foundation, and first phase of the five phases. Empathizing for the user or end-customer, their feedback, and being research savvy is the gateway to understanding the design project(s), and key takeaways towards successful non-bias iterations that will be turned into usable products. Human centered design is more than design; it is a deep insight for design, and research from start to finish.
            Once you are clear on what angle you want to take the research, how to design then becomes an easier application. Depending on the project the angle will be different and will determine how you start.</p>
            <p>Research is key when starting your project, and defining what the problem is that you are going to tackle with the topic at hand. We need to learn who your user is, move and work through the other four phases of the design thinking process: define, ideate, prototype, and test. These may not always apply in chronological order but they must be applicable to the end results and my team's conclusion. I can only accomplish this by staying a teamplayer, flexible, adaptable, and open-minded to all the pieces that can change at any given time.</p>
            <p>Learning to withhold my own biases if it doesn't align with that of the user, the company, and the stakeholders is for the good of the end result. I apply all the design, and research to “birth” new projects that allow for the user, the company’s core values, and the testing done to “honor” who they are or aim to be(come).</p>
